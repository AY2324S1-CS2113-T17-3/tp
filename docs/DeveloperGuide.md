## Design & implementation

<img src="UML Diagrams/Architecture_Diagram.png" width="280">

The architecture diagram given above explains the high level design of the application. The diagram depicts the key
component of the application that enables it to provide its functionalities.

Majority of the app's work is done by the following components

- Login System : Handles user authentication before enabling app usage
- Ui : Asks for user input by handling output messages
- Parser : Makes sense of user input
- Commands : List of various commands
- CommandResult : Execution of various commands

The section below will explain in more detail the design considerations, implementations and rationale of the various
components listed above.

### Login System Component

---

The login system component seeks to authenticate and login existing users or register a new user.

#### Design considerations

- There must be a way to check and verify users with a master list
- The search for existing users username and password must be fast
- Master list must be stored separately on hard drive of machine

#### Implementation and rationale

The login system class works in the following way. Upon booting up the application, a txt file
containing a current list of existing users will be loaded into a users attribute within the class in the form of a hash
table.When a user attempts to login to their account, the entered username and password is checked against
the current list of users in the hashtable. If the username and password matches, the user is logged in.

As for registering new users, newly inputted username and password will be saved to the users attribute and this
pair of username and password is then appended to the txt file containing current users. The updated user list will be
loaded into the users attribute when the application is booted up again.

The login system class uses the below methods to achieve its functionality

- `authenticateUserChoice()` -Decides whether the user chooses to register or login
- `newUserCreator()` -Creates a new user for future login
- `loginExistingUser()` -Login existing user
- `loadExistingUsers()` -Load existing users into hashtable for reference

Given below is an example of how the login system class works.

When the user first launches the programme, the Stocker object will be instantiated. The object will
invoke its own `run()` method which will call its own `start()` method. The Stocker object then instantiates a
new UI object which displays the login message by invoking `showLoginMessage()` method. At this point, Stocker object
will also instantiate a new login system object.

The login system object will invoke its own `run()` method to begin the login process. This method begins by loading
existing users into the users attribute of the login system class by `loadExistingusers()` method. it then invokes
`authenticateUserChoice()` to receive an input from the user to whether register or login a user. Based on the input of
the user, either `newUserCreator()` is launched or `loginExistingUser()` methods will be called to register or login a
user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the login system class works when the program is launched.

### Main data structures

---

#### Implementation

##### Drug

The Drug class is very basic class for now. It only contains the product name as well as it's expiry date, but we will soon add some new properties such as product description, etc...

##### Inventory

The Inventory class is used to keep track of the quantity of product in stock. The hash map seemed to be the most appropriate data structure to match a product id to a quantity and a product entity which are encapsulated in a "StockEntry" class.

##### Cart

The Cart class is used to represent an ongoing transaction : to perform a sale, the vendor can add different products with their respective quantities in a cart which will be deducted from the inventory at the checkout.
To represent this, we chose to use an arraylist of "CartEntry" classes which reprensent a product/quantity tuple.

##### SalesList

The SalesList is used to represent every past sales in order to create some statistics and reports. This class is only a list of subclasses representing validated carts.

## Commands

---

## 1. Find Function

The "Find" function is designed to enable users to search for specific drugs in the inventory using either the drug's
name or the drugs expiry date. This component assists in locating and retrieving relevant drugs efficiently.

**Design Considerations**
The design of the "Find" function takes into account the following considerations:

1. **Search Criteria:** The function must provide users with the ability to specify each criteria, such as keywords or
   attributes, to filter the items they are looking for.
2. **Search Speed:** To enhance user experience, the search process should be fast and responsive, ensuring that users
   receive search results quickly.

**Implementation and Rationale**

The "Find" function is implemented as follows:

- **User-Defined Search Criteria:** Users provide search criteria, such as keywords, to define what they
  are looking for. The "Find" function processes these criteria to locate relevant items.

- **Search Algorithm:** A robust search algorithm is employed to efficiently scan through the list of items and identify
  those
  that match the specified criteria.

- **Result Presentation:** The function displays the search results, presenting users with a list of items that meet the
  search criteria, allowing them to quickly identify the items they are interested in.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The "Find" function is integrated into the user interface, making it easily accessible
  and intuitive for users to perform searches.

- **Alternative Consideration:** During the design process, alternative approaches to searching are evaluated to ensure
  the
  most effective and user-friendly method is implemented.

The "Find" function offers a valuable way for users to narrow down their searches, find specific items of interest, and
enhance the usability of the application.

**Function Methods**

The "Find" function includes the following method to achieve its functionality:

- `execute()` - This method is responsible for executing the "Find" command, searching for drugs that match the
  user-specified keyword within the inventory.
- It returns a `CommandResult` containing the outcome of the command execution,
  which includes a success message and a list of found StockEntry objects.

**Example Usage**

To illustrate how the "Find" function works, consider the following example usage:

1. **User Input:** The user initiates the "Find" command by typing something like the following:

`find /n panadol` - This command instructs the program to search for drugs in the inventory based on the name criteria
and the keyword "panadol."
`find /d 12/03/2026` - This command instructs the program to search for drugs in the inventory based on the expiry date
criteria and the keyword "12/03/2026."

2. **Method Execution:** The `execute()` method within the "FindCommand" class is called. It takes the provided keyword
   and criterion as input.

3. **Search Process:** The method processes the search by iterating through the list of `StockEntry` objects in the
   inventory.
   For each entry, it checks if the `matches` method returns `true`, which means that the drug name or expiry date
   contains the given keyword.
4. **Building Results:** As matching entries are found, they are added to a list called `foundEntries`.
5. **Result Display:** The `CommandResult` is prepared, containing a success message (e.g., "Listed all drugs with the
   keyword
   in the inventory.") and the list of found `StockEntry` objects.
6. `User Feedback:` The result is then displayed to the user, showing a list of drugs in the inventory that match the
   specified keyword.

### Target user profile

- Works in the field of drug distribution, such as pharmacies and doctors' offices.
- Manages a large inventory of pharmaceuticals with varying details (expiration dates, manufacturers, storage
  conditions).
- Prefers desktop applications for their work.
- Proficient in fast typing.

2. Efficient tracking of incoming stock.
3. Categorization of drugs based on various labels.
4. A prioritized list of urgently needed restocks for timely replenishment.
5. Assistance in generating comprehensive reports for stock turnover analysis.
6. Secure access through individual user accounts to safeguard patient healthcare data.
7. Enhanced user experience for experienced professionals who prefer keyboard commands and CLI interactions for seamless
