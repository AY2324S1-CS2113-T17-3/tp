Note

### `add` - Adds drug into inventory list

Adds a drug to be tracked by the system.

- Each individual drug is uniquely identified by a serial number.
- If the input data includes the same serial number, name, and expiry date, it will simply increase the quantity of the
  existing drug in the system.
- If the serial number is the same but either the name or expiry date is different, an error will be returned as the
  system expects consistent information for the same serial number.
- If it has a different serial number, a new entry will be added to the inventory for
  that drug.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the system will also add a new entry to the inventory.
